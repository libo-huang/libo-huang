Welcome to my GitHub. 

I am currently an Assistant Researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science ([ICT, CAS](http://www.ict.ac.cn/)).

My research lies in **machine learning theories** and **deep learning applications**, with a special focus on building memorizing visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. 

If you have any questions about my projects, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:www.huanglibo@gmail.com).
